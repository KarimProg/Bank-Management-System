## Description

## Algorithms and Data Structures

- The program uses a simple linear search algorithm to search for
    accounts by account number.
- The program saves the accounts to a .txt file, where each account is saved on a new line, and
    a comma separates each field, and creates it if it doesn’t exist.
- The program saves all account transactions in a .txt file, where each transaction is saved on a

## new line.


- The program uses bubble sort to sort the accounts by name,
balance, and date opened.
